## The name
The official brand name is *Server State*. In technical applications, this gets abbreviated to *server-state*.

```hint|warning
**Abbreviations** 

Because of associations with the German NS time, an abbreviation of *SS* is **not allowed**.

If, for some reason, an abbreviation is needed, use *SerSta*.
```


## Product names
Products of the *Server State* organization get named in the pattern

> "Server State [prodct name]"

after first calling it by this full name, it's possible to either abbreviate *Server State* to *SerSta* or drop the prefix all together:

> "SerSta [product name]"
> "[product name]"

We allow this when it's clear from context that the product belongs to the Server State ecosystem.
